This Project started around the beginning of March 2016. 
I decided that I wanted to learn Python and use it for creating a database. I was able to learn how to bring in an EXCEL spreadsheet into SQlite and make a window in tKinter to put in data and update the database. I just cannot figure out yet how to do a search and have the data show up in the label windows.
